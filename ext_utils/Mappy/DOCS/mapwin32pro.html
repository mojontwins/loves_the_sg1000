<h3>About MapWin32 Pro</h3>

<p><br>
&nbsp; MapWin32 Pro is an extended, professional version of MappyWin32 by the 
same author. It has all the features of MappyWin32 plus a tile graphic editor, 
brush selector and object/area editor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; MapWin32 Pro is not free, but you can try out all the Pro features (except 
saving and object export) by selecting the pro demo in mapwin.ini 
(set proregnumber=00000001).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you want to buy a registration number (required to enable map saving and object 
export) you can get one at www.tilemap.co.uk If you are interested or have suggestions, 
please contact me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To select which version to use (free, pro demo or pro full), open the 
mapwin.ini file (see main docs on how to do this) and change the 
<strong>proregnumber</strong> according to the instructions in the file.

<h3>Tile graphic editor</h3>

<p><br>
&nbsp; You can use New, Cut, Copy and Paste (Edit menu) to manipulate the 
raw graphics when the 'Graph' window is active. 
If you originally imported a picture for graphics doing 
this may change the order, so you may need to export the graphics if 
you want to import them again. If you want, you can make 
an entire map without importing any graphics, instead creating them here. 
Paste pastes over the selected graphic, 
rather than inserting a new one (unlike the other windows). Use New to 
insert a new, blank graphic. Cut, Copy, 
and Paste also use the Windows clipboard, so you can use an external 
paint package to alter individual tiles and paste them back.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To use a newly created graphic in the map, it must be put in a 
Block Structure. The quick way to do this is click the 'BLK' button 
below the graphic.<br>
<br>
All maps have a 256 colour palette:<br>
* 8bit (paletted) maps modify all the pixels of a set colour index 
if you change that indexes colour<br>
* 15/16/24 and 32 bit maps do NOT modify colours in the graphics, the 
palette is used to store colours you want to use and can be changed 
whenever you like<br>
<br>
Click the colour squares in the palette to select an index<br>
Use the colour bars below to change the colour of an index<br>
<br>
Palette tools:<br>
* CPY - Click index to copy in palette, then CPY, then dest index 
in palette<br>
* EXG - Click index to exchange in palette, then EXG, then dest index 
in palette, the two indexes will be swapped<br>
* SPR - Click index to spread from in palette, then SPR, then dest 
index in palette, the indexes between will be smoothly spread in a gradient<br>
* TRN - 8bit changes the current index to the 8bit transparent index, 
15/16/24/32bit changes the current index to the 24bit colourkey<br>
*  ?  - Click ? then a pixel in the block to the left to:<br>
8bit changes to the index of that pixel<br>
15/16/24/32bit changes the current index to the pixels colour (hold ctrl 
when clicking the pixel to attempt to find the colour in the palette)<br>
<br>
Click in the area in the top left to edit the graphics<br>
<br>
Graphic Tools:<br>
NOTE: The following 3 operations physically alter the block graphics, 
they are not the same as selecting flipped tile mode or rotated tile mode 
and using the block properties to modify how the block is drawn<br>
* FLH - Flips the current graphic horizontally<br>
* FLV - Flips the current graphic vertically<br>
* ROT - Rotates the current graphic 90 degrees<br>
* CLR - Clears the current graphic to the selected index/colour<br>
* MSK - Masks out the current graphic with the clickmask graphic (for 
non-rectangular tiles)<br>
* BLK - Creates a new still block with this graphic as the BG<br>
* REV - Reverts the current graphic to before lat draw, 
also crtl+z (undo).<br>
<br>
Keys:<br>
Use the arrow keys to slide the graphic (useful to smooth the joins at the edges)<br>
The current map position is shown in the bottom right corner and changes 
as you modify the graphics, zoom also works on this.<br>
'l' will draw a line between the last pixel placed and the mouse position<br>
'f' will fill the area at the mouse position with current colour<br>
'p' will pick the colour at the mouse position (same as '?' button, but not with ctrl key)<br>
<br>
Draw size shows the thickness of the drawing tool when you edit the graphic<br>
<br>
Tip: Use CLR to fill a new graphic with selected colour, then use MSK to 
get the right shape for non-rectangular tiles (try it with isotst.fmp or 
hextst.fmp).<br>

<h3>Brush selector</h3>

<p><br>
&nbsp; This shows the brushes (from the brush menu), you can select them 
by clicking then edit the map with them.<br>

<h3>Object Editor</h3>

<p><br>
&nbsp; You can use New, Cut, Copy and Paste (Edit menu) to manipulate 
objects when the 'Object' window is active. Click an object to select, 
doubleclick an object to change its properties. An object is represented 
either by a tile graphic, or part (or all) of an external graphic file. 
Add an external graphic file (any format, 24bit pics can be used on 8bit 
maps if you want) with the 'Add' button. An object can be any size 
and positioned at any pixel coordinate (even off the map). Set its position 
either in the properties, or left click in the map window when it is 
selected. Hold the shift key to align the object to the tile boundaries 
as you click in the map window. Hold the shift key as you select an object 
in the Object window to go to its location in the map window. Colourkey is 
used when drawing objects.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The Object properties consist of map X, Y pixel coord to the handle 
of the object. If you choose an external graphic, the Tile Graphic must be 
set to 0. You can make a list of shared External Graphics with the 'Add' 
button. Select the area of the graphic for the object with the Coords 
section. The User data area is for your own use. You can set the border 
colour of an object with the 'Col:' field in the object properties. The selected 
object is highlighted with a white border. For no border, use 000000 
(transparent), for black, use 000001.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Objects can be exported with File:Export as text (Pro full version 
only), they are stored in the FMP file as OBDT chunks, example code to read 
them (I will update the playback libs to do this eventually):<br><br>

<h3>Area editor</h3>

<p><br>
&nbsp; This is incorporated into the Object editor, to define an area, make 
a new object with 'area only' as the graphic, and set the width and height 
you want, then place the area just like an object. You can set the border 
colour of an area with the 'Col:' field in the object properties. The selected 
object is highlighted with a white border. For no border, use 000000 
(transparent), for black, use 000001.<br>

<h3>Labels</h3>

<p><br>
&nbsp; A label is just an Area with 0 width and height and a textstring.
