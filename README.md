# Mojon Twins loves the SG-1000

This is a port of [MTE MK1 NES / AGNES](https://github.com/mojontwins/MK1_NES) to the **SEGA SG-1000** (and, therefore, the **SEGA Master System**) console.

Albeit there are [some differencies](https://github.com/mojontwins/loves_the_sg1000/blob/master/docs/AGSG1000_requirements.md), the code is almost verbatim - the main difference is that this version is divided in several modules and the NES version is monolithic.
